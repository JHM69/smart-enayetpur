              Content and Behavior Rules
            </h1>
            <p>
              You can only use MPBIAN for lawful purposes. You’re responsible
              for all the content that you post on our platform. You should keep
              the reviews, questions, posts, courses, and other content you
              upload in line with our Trust & Safety Guidelines and the law, and
              respect the intellectual property rights of others. We can ban
              your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think someone
              is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know. You may
              not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful
              purposes. Your use of the Services and behavior on our platform
              must comply with applicable local or national laws or regulations
              of your country. You are solely responsible for the knowledge of
              and compliance with such laws and regulations that are applicable
              to you.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are a student, the Services enable you to ask questions to
              the instructors of courses or other content you are enrolled in,
              and to post reviews of content. For certain content, the
              instructor may invite you to submit content as “homework” or
              tests. Don’t post or submit anything that is not yours. If you are
              an instructor, you can submit content for publication on the
              platform and you can also communicate with the students who have
              enrolled in your courses or other content. In both cases, you must
              abide by the law and respect the rights of others: you cannot post
              any course, question, answer, review, or other content that
              violates applicable local or national laws or regulations of your
              country. You are solely responsible for any courses, content, and
              actions you post or take via the platform and Services and their
              consequences. Make sure you understand all the copyright
              restrictions before you submit any content for publication on
              MPBIAN. If we are put on notice that your course or content
              violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is
              established that it violates intellectual property or image rights
              of others, or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that
              your content or behavior violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines,
              or if we believe your content or behavior is unlawful,
              inappropriate, or objectionable (for example if you impersonate
              someone else), we may remove your content from our platform.
              MPBIAN complies with copyright laws.

              MPBIAN Rights to Content You Post
            </h2>
            <p>
              You retain ownership of content you post to our platform,
              including your courses. We’re allowed to share your content to
              anyone through any media, including promoting it via advertising
              on other websites. The content you post as a student or instructor
              (including courses) remains yours. By posting courses and other
              content, you allow MPBIAN to reuse and share it but you do not
              lose any ownership rights you may have over your content.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you
              submit to us ideas and suggestions for new features or
              improvements, you authorize MPBIAN to use and share this content
              with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in
              any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit.
              In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through
              the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive,
              royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy,
              reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and
              distribute your content (including your name and image) in any and
              all media or distribution methods (existing now or later
              developed).
            </p>

            <p>
              This includes making your content available to other companies,
              organizations, or individuals who partner with MPBIAN for the
              syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication of content on
              other media, as well as using your content for marketing purposes.
              You also waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights
              of a similar nature applicable to all these uses, to the extent
              permissible under applicable law. You represent and warrant that
              you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to
              authorize us to use any content that you submit. You also agree to
              all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you.

              Using MPBIAN at Your Own Risk
            </h2>
            <p>
              Anyone can use MPBIAN to create and publish content and
              instructors and we enable instructors and students to interact for
              teaching and learning. Like other platforms where people can post
              content and interact, some things can go wrong, and you use MPBIAN
              at your own risk. Our platform model means we do not review or
              edit the content for legal issues, and we are not in a position to
              determine the legality of content. We do not exercise any
              editorial control over the content that is available on the
              platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the
              reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness of the content.
              If you access content, you rely on any information provided by an
              instructor at your own risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you
              consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. MPBIAN has no
              responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for
              your access or enrollment in any course or other content, to the
              extent permissible under applicable law. This also applies to any
              content relating to health, wellness, and physical exercise. You
              acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature
              of these types of content, and by accessing such content, you
              choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including the risk of
              illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full
              responsibility for the choices you make before, during, and after
              your access to the content. When you interact directly with a
              student or an instructor, you must be careful about the types of
              personal information that you share. While we restrict the types
              of information instructors may request from students, we do not
              control what students and instructors do with the information they
              obtain from other users on the platform. You should not share your
              email or other personal information about you for your safety.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are not responsible or liable for any interactions involved
              between instructors and students. We are not liable for disputes,
              claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise
              out of or relate to the conduct of instructors or students. When
              you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that
              we don’t own or control. We are not responsible for the content or
              any other aspect of these third-party sites, including their
              collection of information about you. You should also read their
              terms and conditions and privacy policies. We allow advertisers to
              display their advertisements and other information in certain
              areas of the Site, such as sidebar advertisements or banner
              advertisements. If you are an advertiser, you shall take full
              responsibility for any advertisements you place on the Site and
              any services provided on the Site or products sold through those
              advertisements. Further, as an advertiser, you warrant and
              represent that you possess all rights and authority to place
              advertisements on the Site, including, but not limited to,
              intellectual property rights, publicity rights, and contractual
              rights.
