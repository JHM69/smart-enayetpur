            <p>
              Anyone can use MPBIAN to create and publish content and
              instructors and we enable instructors and students to interact for
              teaching and learning.

            <h2 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">MPBIAN Rights</h2>
            <p>
              We own the MPBIAN platform and Services, including the website,
              present or future apps and services, and things like our logos,
              API, code, and content created by our employees.

            <h2 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Pricing</h2>
            <p>
              The prices of content on MPBIAN are determined based on the terms
              of the Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy. In some
              instances, the price of content offered on the website may not be
              exactly the same as the price offered on our mobile or TV
              applications, due to mobile platform providers’ pricing systems
              and their policies around implementing sales and promotions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during
              which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set
              period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the
              price at the time you complete your purchase of the content (at
              checkout). Any price offered for particular content may also be
              different when you are logged into your account from the price
              available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because
              some of our promotions are available only to new users.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax,
              goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to
              consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting
              that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your
              location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be
              added at checkout.
            </p>

            <h2 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Payments</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you
              authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other
              means of payment (such as Boleto, SEPA, direct debit, or mobile
              wallet) for those fees. MPBIAN works with payment service
              providers to offer you the most convenient payment methods in your
              country and to keep your payment information secure. We may update
              your payment methods using information provided by our payment
              service providers. Check out our Privacy Policy for more details.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or
              unauthorized payment method. If your payment method fails and you
              will not get access to the content you are enrolling in. We
              reserve the right to disable access to any content for which we
              have not received adequate payment.
            </p>

            <h2 className="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Refunds Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Course fee is refundable if the course you purchased is not
              available to you or you bought this course by mistake. Only then
              your request will be considered within 3 days of your purchase of
              the course, that MPBIAN will refund your account. A refund request
              will be finalized valid only if made through an email to
              mpbianofficial@gmail.com specifying your email address or phone
              number used during registration within 3 days from the time of
              purchase.
            </p>

            <p>
              No refund request will be considered valid after 3 days of
              purchase. Refunds shall be made to the bank, mobile financial
              services account, or card with which the purchase was made within
              10 working days of the refund request being successfully processed
              and approved by MPBIAN. This confirmation will be sent to the user
              by email.
            </p>

            <p>
              We reserve the right to apply for a refund, at our discretion,
              depending on the capabilities of our payment processing partners
              or the platform from which you purchased your course (website or
              mobile app).
